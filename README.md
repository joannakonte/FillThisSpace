### Description
This website was my team's final project for the 2021 [Kode With Klossy](https://www.kodewithklossy.com) Virtual Web Development Camp. 
Our website *Fill This Space* provides resources for women to discover female centered communities where they can flourish and be their true self. We also offer women the chance to explore new fields such as literature, sports and STEM and get involved in activities like chess, cooking and dancing.
