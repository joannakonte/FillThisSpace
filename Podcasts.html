    <p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/life-i-swear/id1511077613">Life, I Swear</a> was conceived in 2012 after a 2 a.m. conversation among friends that reflected on the ebbs and flows of their respective lives. Since then, other women of color have appeared on the show, willing to share their honest storiesâ€”especially the ones of trial and triumph. These challenges, though tough, allowed them to heal, connect, and process. Listeners can hear Julee Wilson, Beauty Director at Cosmopolitan, discuss the power of affirmations, and artist Deun Ivory invite trauma survivors to feel safe and supported.  </p>
