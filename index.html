    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p class="aboutWeb">Our website <em>Fill This Space</em> provides resources for women that enables them to discover environments in female centered (female only) communities, ranging from education to fun activities. Around the world, women are constantly surrounded by stereotypes, leading them to feel uncomfortable and unsafe in their daily environments. Our goal is to provide women with tools and places where they do not have to feel judged. We aim to "Fill" the world with more women at the top of male dominated industries. Everyone is more capable of pursuing activities when they feel they are being supported in their environment.</p>

  <p class="aboutWeb">Hello! We are the creators of <em>Fill This Space</em>! We are four young women from across the globe, that were able to come together to code. After bonding and unveiling our individual passions for gender inequality issues, we came up with this tool to provide women with easy-access resources. Kode with Klossy provided us with the coding superpowers to construct this website, and we are ecstatic to be able to share what we have created with you all.</p>
